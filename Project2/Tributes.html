<h1> Here's what people have to say about Rent A Pet! </h1>

<p>
My name is Bessie Anderson and I currently live in a retirement community that has a prohibition on pets.  I really wanted to have a <br>
small dog that I could take out for walks, but I though it was not possible.  Then I heard about Rent A Pet and I was excited to give it a try.  <br>
I found a  loveable bassett hound and met her when she was delivered to my apartment one Saturday morning.  We went through a long walk in the<br> 
nearby park and had a wonderful time.  The great Rent A Pet staff came and picked her up two hours later and I didn't even have to worry about <br>
feeding or watering "Sophie".  We now have a regular appointment every Saturday, if the weather permits.  I know I look forward to getting in <br>
my weekly walk in the park and I imagine Sophie likes it as well.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for giving me something to look forward to each week,
</p>
<p>
Yours,<br>

I'm a single college guy and live in an apartment with 3 other guys.  I always wanted to have a large breed of dog that would be a companion to take <br>
running or play catch with in the park.  With the help of Rent A Pet, I found Kamaikaze, a German Shephard.  He loves to run in the summer and even <br>
cross country ski in the winter.  The best thing Kazi likes to do is play Frisbee and run through an obstacle course.  I always attract the attention <br>
of girls in the park when we go there.  I even met my fiance, Janice, when she joined Kazi and me in a heated game of keep away.  One day I will have <br>
a home where I can have a yard to keep my own dog.  Until that time, I can still enjoy the companionship of a good dog.

Thanks to Rent A Pet,<br>

My business requires me to travel quite a bit.  So it would be hard for me to own a pet of my own.  I would have to constantly find someone to pet sit, <br>
or I would have to pay for boarding the pet.  I also like to surprise and shock my friends with my unusual pets. Rent A Pet is a perfect solution for my <br>
lifestyle.  I have rented a snake, a Saint Bernard, a pot belly pig and an iguana.  I know my nurturing skills are sadly lacking because I cannot even keep <br>
a house plant alive.  I can have fun with exotic pets without having the worry about keeping them healthy and happy.  Thanks for adding spice to my life.<br>

As a young girl, I developed a love of horses.  But I grew up in the city and never had the chance to own my own horse.  I was delighted to find Rent A Pet. <br> 
They have several horses to choose from for riders of different levels.  They will deliver the horse to the trail where I want to ride.  Because I can request <br>
the same horse time after time, I have become very comfortable with my skills and the abilities of the horse I ride.  I would never be able to provide room and <br>
board for my own animal.

Thanks for making a dream come true,

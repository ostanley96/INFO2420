<h3 id="Beginning">In the Beginning ...</h3>
<p>
Rent A Pet began with a family that loved dogs.  George Smith and his wife Carol owned two Irish Setters.  These dogs were pets <br>
 to the Smith family children and extended family members.  One day as George was walking his dogs in the park, he noticed how <br>
they attracted the attention of passing women.  They seemed to like to stop what they were doing and ask him about his dogs. <br> 
A young woman remarked that she would love to have a big dog like that to walk, but she had a small apartment and couldn't <br>
keep a large dog.  This brief encounter was the beginning of an idea.  What if there were others, possible many others, <br>
who wanted companionship of pets without the responsibility? Maybe people would be willing to pay to rent or borrow a pet for <br>
a short period of time.
</p>
George shared his idea with Carol and they began to look at the pros and cons related to start a small business that would rent dogs for a day.  <br>
<h4>Some of the advantages of this kind of business would be:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Renters could have access to the pet at their leisure</li>
<li>Renters could pick the pet they wanted</li>
<li>Renters could exercise with the pet </li>
<li>Renters could have companionship of a pet</li>
<li>Renters would not have to pay for upkeep or medical expenses</li>
<li>The owners could have many pets and enjoy them</li>
</ul>

<h4>Some of the disadvantages for this business would be:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The business would need to take care of housing and feeding</li>
<li>The business would need to provide medical expenses</li>
<li>The business would need to have liability insurance </li>
<li>The owners would be tied down with the care of the pets</li>
</ul>

After weighing these points, the Smiths decided to go ahead by starting small and in the fall of 1980 started Rent a Pet.  The business offered its <br>
customers the companionship of a pet without all the care of the extra expense or hassles of ownership. They began with only providing dogs for rent.  <br>
Since the company's inception, Rent a Pet has extended their offerings by also adding cats, horses, pigs and snakes for rent.<br>

<p>
Rent a Pet has expanded from its early location in Provo and now has franchises in Logan, Bountiful, Salt Lake City, and St. George.  <br>
They employ their own trained vet and have yet to have any accidents due to their rental pets. Rent a Pet also employs an animal trainer <br>
who works with the dogs and horses daily.
</p>
<p>
Rent a Pet has attracted many satisfied customers.  The company frequently provides their services to senior citizens who reside in retirement homes <br>
that prohibit pet ownership. A senior can enjoy a dog or cat for the day and even take them for a walk.  Surprisingly, young men looking to strike up <br>
a conversation with young women often rent dogs that like jogging or playing Frisbee.  Specially trained trick dogs can be rented for parties or appearances <br>
in movies or commercials.  The most unusual pet, snakes, are usually rented for Halloween or other occasions where the customer wants to use them for shock value.  <br>
